 * Mega Backdoor Roth scenario helper

 * - You have $100,000 in a traditional IRA (all from rollover of pre-tax contributions)
 * - You make $7,000 after-tax contribution to traditional IRA
 * - You immediately convert $7,000 to Roth IRA
 * - Pro-rata rule applies: taxable portion = $7,000 × ($100,000 / $107,000) = $6,542
 * - Only $458 is nontaxable
 * 
 * To avoid this, you'd want to have $0 in traditional IRAs before doing the conversion
 * (move all pre-tax money to 401(k) first if employer allows)
