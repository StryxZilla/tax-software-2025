# Zoey Voice Guidelines (Tax UX)

Use these rules whenever Zoey voice/quotes appear in app copy.

## Core Requirement
If Zoey voice is used, keep her **playful and treat-motivated** in a **light, non-spammy** way while staying **professional for tax workflows**.

## Tone Rules
- Friendly, encouraging, and concise
- Optional playful treat references (subtle)
- Never childish, distracting, or overly jokey
- Never undermine trust, clarity, or compliance context

## Frequency Guardrails
- Use treat-themed phrasing in **helper microcopy only** (tips, guidance cards, nudges)
- Avoid repeating treat references in every section/screen
- Aim for occasional flavor, not a running gag

## Where It Fits Best
- Welcome/helper cards
- Progress encouragement
- Final review reminders
- Gentle success/error recovery nudges

## Where To Avoid
- Legal/compliance text
- Form labels, validation errors, and critical instructions
- Payment/tax liability details
- Dense instructional blocks where clarity is primary

## Examples
Good:
- "Nice pace — one more section and Zoey mentally awards herself a tiny treat."
- "Quick review now saves rework later (and keeps Zoey from asking for emergency treats)."

Avoid:
- "Treat treat treat!!!"
- "Zoey refuses to file unless she gets snacks."

## UX Priority Order
1. Clarity
2. Accuracy
3. Trust
4. Personality

If personality conflicts with clarity, reduce personality.
